#####################               SUPER BHO PRIVACY POLICY


This is a free game developed by Karim Santoro. 

This app does not collect any user data and does not communicate any personal data to third parties societies. In the current state of publication and compliant with this document, the app does NOT even show advertisements.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 

Super Bho uses information sharing only in its online version, where (if registered by the player) the files for the player picture are shared with one's opponent. No server holds any of this data. Data is not saved to external devices.
The data exchanged is only used on the spot to make the gaming experience more enjoyable. The app does not hold any user information.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

in order for the user to customize the available players, the app requires access to the camera and gallery. These permissions are used exclusively to allow the user to create their own characters. The app also asks permission to use the microphone with the same previous purpose: to allow the user to significantly customize the gaming experience.
The permissions mentioned above are useful for the enjoyment of Super Bho but not indispensable and I declare to the fullest of my powers that the permissions mentioned above are NOT used for other purposes than those just described.

For any extra questions about this app feel free to write me an email and I will reply as soon as possible.



I really hope you enjoy my app. I wish you have good time with your friends with Super Bho!

Yours sincerely, 
Santoro Karim.
